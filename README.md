IPL EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) involves analyzing IPL-related data to uncover insights and patterns. 
It starts with collecting data on match scores, player statistics, and team performance, followed by cleaning the data to address any missing values or errors. 
Descriptive statistics are calculated to understand central tendencies, and visualizations like charts and graphs are created to reveal trends and relationships. 
The analysis includes examining patterns over seasons, identifying correlations between variables, detecting anomalies, and comparing different teams and players. 
This process helps improve team strategies, evaluate player performance, engage fans, and assist in betting analysis, using tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
